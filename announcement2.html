            <strong>Subject: </strong>FSA and HSA Legislation Change<br> 
            <br>
            Recently passed legislation, in response to COVID-19, has included over-the-counter (OTC) 
            medicine and medical supplies, including menstrual care products as<br>
            qualified medical expenses for FSA and HSA accounts.  If you currently have a FSA or HSA 
            account, you may now claim OTC medicine and medical supplies <br>
            beginning retroactively to January 1, 2020 and for the indefinite future (no end date was 
            provided). IRS has not yet published a list of OTC medicines and supplies, <br>
            but that should be out soon.<br><br>
            In addition, below are a couple of helpful links.<br><br>
