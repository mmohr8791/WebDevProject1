            <strong>From: </strong>Human Resources<br>
            <strong>Subject: </strong>Washable and Preventive Masks<br> 
        </p>
        <p>
        In the likelihood that our various States and/or Counties may require the use of personal preventive masks 
        while out in public, RTP Company sought out a local manufacturer to make<br>
        personal, washable, preventive masks as a benefit for each of our employees.  
        <br><br>
        These masks are non-medical grade and are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and cannot replace the 
        required N95 masks or respirators when working in areas that require such.  <br>
        The masks are reusable and launderable with general laundry detergent (no bleach). The material is tightly 
        woven with a high-end anti-microbial material and an elastic band to firmly <br>
        fit the mask around oneâ€™s face and nose. 
        <br><br>
        These masks should arrive by Monday, April 27, 2020 and we will begin distribution to the various US 
        facilities and departments upon arrival.  Employees are welcome to pick up a <br>
        courtesy mask from their plant manager or department manager.  Employees may also choose to make their own masks.  Please see attached flyer from CDC on 
        how to make your own <br>
        masks with t-shirt or bandana material.
        <br><br>
        Thank you and please continue to adhere to social distancing efforts as we fight this pandemic.
