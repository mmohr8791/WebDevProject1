        <strong>From: </strong>Human Resources<br>
        <strong>Subject: </strong>FSA and HSA Legislation Change<br> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently passed legislation, in response to COVID-19, has included over-the-counter (OTC) 
        medicine and medical supplies, including menstrual care products as<br>
        qualified medical expenses for FSA and HSA accounts.  If you currently have a FSA or HSA 
        account, you may now claim OTC medicine and medical supplies <br>
        beginning retroactively to January 1, 2020 and for the indefinite future (no end date was 
        provided). IRS has not yet published a list of OTC medicines and supplies, <br>
        but that should be out soon.<br><br>
