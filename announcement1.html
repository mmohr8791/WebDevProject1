            <strong>From: </strong>Human Resources<br>
            <strong>Subject: </strong>Washable and Preventive Masks<br> 
        <br>
            In the likelihood that our various States and/or Counties may require the use of personal preventive masks 
            while out in public, RTP Company sought out a local manufacturer to make<br>
            personal, washable, preventive masks as a benefit for each of our employees.<br><br>
            These masks are non-medical grade and are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and cannot replace the 
            required N95 masks or respirators when working in areas that require such.<br>
            The masks are reusable and launderable with general laundry detergent (no bleach). The material is tightly 
            woven with a high-end anti-microbial material and an elastic band to firmly<br>
            fit the mask around oneâ€™s face and nose.<br><br>
            These masks should arrive by Monday, April 27, 2020 and we will begin distribution to the various US 
            facilities and departments upon arrival.  Employees are welcome to pick up a<br>
            courtesy mask from their plant manager or department manager.  Employees may also choose to make their own masks.  
            Please see attached flyer from CDC on how to make your own<br>
            masks with t-shirt or bandana material.<br><br>
            Thank you and please continue to adhere to social distancing efforts as we fight this pandemic.
